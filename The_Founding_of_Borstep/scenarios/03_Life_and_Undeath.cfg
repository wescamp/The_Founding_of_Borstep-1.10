# Every orcish unit that is killed is changed into a ghost (assuming the
# necromancer is alive, which he should be). The level of the ghost will be the
# same as the original unit. The ghost will also keep all experience, and level
# immediately if it has enough.

			story= _ "The forests in this area had plenty of food, but the orcs were uncomfortable staying in a place that was so exposed and difficult to defend, so they were soon itching to move on. Krag-Ubor had a destination in mind, and led his people south. They had not travelled far when they encountered elves arguing with a human. It was strange to see a human this far north, but Krag-Ubor didn't ponder the oddity for long because his people were hungry again."
