# If you kill the orcish leader, one of the hero units takes over as the leader
# and can recruit. Kill him, and one more takes over.

# Units on villages and the fort wall cannot move. The USE_FROZEN_UNITS macro
# sets up the mechanics of that. Two different macros let you make a unit unable
# to move.

			story= _ "The tribe marched west along the road as the weather continued to cool, and a blanket of snow crept down the mountain peaks in the distance. They came to a fort they had passed on their way north with Pash-Grod, and which Krag-Ubor had had in mind from the beginning of their journey."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story= _ "The fort looked difficult to assail, but Krag-Ubor's people had been emboldened by their previous victories, and no battle seemed impossible. They growled and banged their swords on their chests as Krag-Ubor made ready to challenge the ruler of this tribe. On the distant top of the wall, a disturbance was taking place, and the chill air carried voices to the plains below. Krag-Ubor paused to listen, thinking that perhaps the events occurring in the fort would be to his advantage."
